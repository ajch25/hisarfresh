## RETURN POLICY

#### Hisar Fresh

ELFREDS COMMERCE LLP (“ECL”) has a “NO QUESTIONS ASKED RETURN AND REFUND POLICY” which entitles all users to return the product at the time of delivery if due to some reason they are not satisfied with the quality or freshness of the product. ECL will take the returned product back and issue a credit note for the value of the return products, which will be credited to your account on the Site. Such credit shall be available for use against a subsequent invoice for transactions on the Site.

However, once the product has been accepted by the user, the scope of refunds is limited. Perishable and/or Intimate goods such as food, flowers, breads, or sanitary lose their saleability quickly. 

Post the delivery of the order, ECL shall decide at its own discretion whether the product is fit for reselling and/or whether to accept the return and/or refund request for the same. ECL is not bound for any returns or refunds after the delivery of the products. ECL does consider returns for products unfit for usage/consumption at the time of delivery that were delivered to user because of any negligence or error. 

To be eligible for a return, the product must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original product packaging. 

Certain products or services may be available exclusively and may have limited quantities. These products or services are subject to return or exchange based on the availability and other factors.

Please note: Few products listed may or may not carry a seller warranty, which is beyond the basis return policy of ECL. You may be required to contact not ECL but the seller or any other third party in relation to such warranty.

#### Yellow List

We strive to provide 100% satisfaction to all our users but to safeguard ourselves from unsustainable claims, we may maintain a list of accounts with: i) a proportinately high number of refund/return requests, ii) low amount per order, or iii) delayed payments for orders. Any order/claim from such account may be checked or rejected. Further, the account may be restricted. Please note, the purpose of the practice is to help ECL sustain claims and provide its services efficiently. This in no way warrants any judgement on customers' intention.
